"The Worse game app ever 😡 Game keep crashing just at the beginning and almost ending of match and I end up loosing matches I would have won, as if that's not enough y'all keep deducting my ranks for crashing that wasn't my fault, I will delete this app soon and never use it again. And urge anyone trying to download this app to not bother because you might end up smashing your phone.",1,2023-07-17 12:48:22
"Its Amazing, I love playing this, it's as good if not nearly better than the cod's on console. Everything is top tier and the controls are comfortable. The seasons are excitable and fun. There's always diversity and more to return to. Thank you for all of the modes.",5,2023-07-17 01:31:52
I did gave a 5 star before in 2020 but now the game is enjoyable and playable because of some reasons which are as follow: 1. Increase in campers 2. The players don't use O.G guns now they play with which are more powerful than O.G guns example(AK47) 3. They are introducing new sounds of guns in every season which makes some difficulty in recognising the gun(for O.G players),1,2023-07-17 00:16:01
"I love this game. I would give 5stars but there's small problem where most of the time when i play rank match, in the middle of the match i get calls in between and when i answer and leaving the game not quitting but staying in call and coming back it bans me for 4mins and i lose so much rank dat i jus spent hours playing.. please DEV GUYS FIX THIS",4,2023-07-16 23:31:40
"Great Game! 🎯 It's amazing that the developers are able to adapt Call of Duty's world famous action on a mobile phone, especially battle royal mode. Been a fan for more than a decade and the quality continues to improve even today!",5,2023-07-16 23:25:33
I have been playing this game for past year and i have enjoyed every map of the game the graphics is lit but if u ask me ill refer rather playing battle royal u can play a multiplayer that is upto nxt level if u are a beginner thn its a perfect game for Killing the time Wth u get lots of guns and its features 😇 IG @sheikluffy_12,5,2023-07-16 23:11:51
"Great game , smooth controls, somewhat balanced weaponry (after patch) but I have to say the pretty much random spawn in mp is awful and should be replaced with a set spawn and spawn protection.",4,2023-07-16 22:40:12
The game is really good but their are some stuff I wanted to talk about 1. I wish this could be add in the game AI batte royal so it could be easier to practice on shooting 2. The game take up almost all storage I want to fix that. But that was all I wanted to talk about please give me a response if it's cool,3,2023-07-16 20:35:17
"Great game Activison, but I think it'd be really cool if you introduce a dislike button to the like button at the MVP section because some players are really dumb. You'd be losing a lot of ranked match points as a result of their incompetence which is unfair, with them teamwork is just impossible!",5,2023-07-16 18:35:17
Missed out on tournament win due to dropping my game several times. Then puts you in ban for leaving. If some how by some miracle I connect back into the game I was playing that strong win often turns to a lose. So ultimately I'm punished either way. How many WiFi providers you going to gaslight before sorting this issue on your end. Worse part is that the only thing stopping this game be amazing unfortunately,2,2023-07-16 17:47:03
"I love the game, but overtime I'm not going to be able to play it on the same device I had since the release of the game because currently it would be considered a low-end device and most likely wouldn't be compatible with the platform any further if a lot more comes out. You guys release lots of content and all which is good to keep the community thriving, but being poor I wouldn't be able feel the full experience like I use to. Maps not rendering, BR matches crashing, extreme lag spikes, etc.",1,2023-07-16 17:19:02
"Can't believe after playing straight 6 seasons I have to uninstall it. What is the point of Being a mobile game if its 16gb? Why do you keep increasing the size with useless maps, guns and skins that literally nobody cares about except few jokers. We care about smooth gameplay. NB: season 6 also has a lot of bugs",1,2023-07-16 14:19:27
"at first, i saw my older brother playing the game so i decided to install it also to see whats so special about it. when i started playing i fell in love with this game! i was always searching for gun games and cod would be my match! smooth gameplay, easy controls on phone, unreal graphics... it was so fun! also i am still having a problem with campers but that doesnt change anything! i will find the campers and boom! kill! im giving this game 5 stars because its so fun!",5,2023-07-16 11:58:27
It takes forever for anyone with a contorller to find a rank game because instead of mix both contorller and non together u decided to separate like jackass and now I can barely get a game even after waiting for damn near 4 minutes which is ridiculous were u can instantly get a game if u don't use one.,1,2023-07-16 11:34:09
"This game is amazing and ultra realistic because of graphics, physics, gunsmith and the operator's voice😎. I only need you to do one thing, that is, add legendary and mythic items in events and make that type of event more tough to complete because many of the players cannot buy cp.",5,2023-07-16 11:28:59
"Yoo brotha idk what is wrong with this game, since this new update the game is broken, specially in Battle Royal, sometimes shooting at opponents won't do any damage to them and at the very second I find myself dead. Sometimes I can't even repair my armour cz whenever I do it glitches and it's back to 0 armour. Dude do something about it, I've been playing this game for 5 years. Don't make me hate this game.",2,2023-07-16 10:53:52
"About 5 year ago I would have given it a 5 star. But today not easy to clim through the ranks. And some of us are really excited playing rank. Graphics are not like it used to be. You might be in the losing team, but have by far the most kills and yet still lose points. Every month about 2 to 3Gg for updating. You guys really rock, but think of your supporters please.",3,2023-07-16 10:41:06
"The time out issue is solved, finally thanks for taking a look. Now, there's a new problem where enemy is invisible and only become visible after I get killed by him or in kill cam. Its so annoying please solve this issue. It happened with me 3-4 times.",3,2023-07-16 07:44:06
I love this game. The gameplay is top notch. The fact there is no ads is the tipping point to being the best game out there. Only issue people may have is staying connected to server. It does sometimes drop and closes the app. But otherwise a must have on any gamers device,5,2023-07-16 03:23:47
I love the game. I enjoy playing. Your draw system is highway robbery. When I put money in your game thinking I am going to get something cool to play the game with and I get camouflage for a grenade or a parachute or some other useless peice of equipment makes me feel less like playing. Why should it cost 400.00 for a character or a mythic weapon? I enjoyed the game on console because when you spend you get weapons and skins and everything in a bundle. Why can't I just buy a bundle?,2,2023-07-16 02:10:27
"This the best games I ever played. It has high graphics, high sound quality, and a large variety of guns. But I wish there would be more jets like a bomber or a strike fighter in battle royal Or maybe add another type of helicopter.",5,2023-07-16 00:27:47
This game is trash it's full of hackers and it lags no matter how good your internet is 0 out of 5 stars. They can shoot you around corners which is impossible. Snipers don't even have to aim they just look at you and you are dead. They put this magical armor on you that lets you magically take 4 50 cal rounds before you die impossible. And when you're good like me they spawned you with the enemy or literally just spon people literally right behind you. And when you see an enemy it freezes 👎,1,2023-07-15 22:14:03
"One of the best games for mobile platforms. But suspiciously since the last acquisition by you know who, the game doesn't work anymore with the last update. Quite sad for loyal and big fans. Please fix it, my phone is a middle-high end 2019 model.",4,2023-07-15 16:57:31
"The game is great and the gameplay is really smooth on Android compared to other heavy games. The experience is pretty good. But if you optimize/add some things it will be the best mobile game- 1. Please change tapping style, animation and tap sound in main menu options. 2. Please add tactical sprint animations to SMGs and Light ARs that are now only available on mythic guns (This is what we want most) 3. Please improve your game audio (even though the game has high sound, it is still needed)",3,2023-07-15 16:02:40
"I wish I could give it no stars. A mediocre trash excuse for a competitive fps game. If this is the best the future of multiplayer shooters has to offer then we are doomed. There is no real enjoyment to be had when facing real players and even less against the lame can't land a shot ever bots. This dinosaur of a franchise has more than exceeded its expiration date and I wouldn't mind seeing it go. We don't need stinky CODs we need real shooters. Yes, that was a fish joke.",1,2023-07-15 15:48:40
I only play cause I'm a die hard COD fan since it's early days. However the devs of this app piss me off. They give you so many new modes for Multiplayer/ battle royale and some are complete garbage. When in the hell will you guys give us more for the zombies mode??? When the hell will we get more maps for zombies??? When the hell will we get anything for the zombies mode? Hell the zombies mode has not been updated since I started playing it the same plane Jane garbage it's become.,1,2023-07-15 14:50:04
This is the best game I've played but with each update the game is getting laggy and difficult to play for low to mid budget phone gamers. I hope we won't have to quit the game due to device capability issues.,5,2023-07-15 10:30:37
"Many bugs 1... The enemy sees bullets coming out of your gun even when you aren't firing. 2... A lot of lag, especially when there are multiple enemies in one place or someone throws a moltov or thermite. 3... You can't see nova gas affects or the nova gas being thrown. 4... While running, when you try to slide, many times it will just go into crouch. 5... In some cases the enemy can see you even tho you can't see the enemy. When you're behind cover, the enemy can see half of your body.",1,2023-07-15 10:26:27
Overall a solid cod on your phone...However... After update I can only make it on average maybe one to two matches or if I'm in The Load-Out screen or any of the other screens the app closes randomly help!!!!!!!!!!!,5,2023-07-15 09:55:42
I'm really starting to dislike this game and dislike the company. To show favoritism to people who buy the mythic and legendary guns. Not everybody has $100 to be spending like that. We were really appreciate it if you guys could nerve all the shotguns and b are there is no way I am getting killed when I have kinetic armor on and full health and getting one shot they also have legendaries to with no custom drop but when I try to use the shotgun with nothing on it just a plain old regular shotgun,1,2023-07-15 07:03:20
"Giving a two cause it says mobile and great grafics but with every upgrade the game freeze TO MUCH, please fix,spend so many money on it but don't care to delete the game if it continues to freeze. Very disappointing.",2,2023-07-15 04:49:33
Best game to Play to and I love playing this game but some times the settings just change itself but when you restart your Phone the settings will be good again. I mean the problem is that sometimes when you login into the game some features of the game settings will be lost.,2,2023-07-15 03:35:27
"It's been a great game so far. I don’t know why, but suddenly I'm unable to get into my account and play. Even after entering in my password it still won't go. Worst part, I can't even reset the password because I never get the confirmation email. Really missing this game..",3,2023-07-14 20:35:14
I think makers also lose the interest some times log in error sometimes configuration failed game is really going worse day by day I think it has a problem while switching the from one wifi to other installed and un itntalled a lot many times still the same though I was in love with this game but makers have no interest in users as they are quite satisfied in there swet deal,1,2023-07-14 19:09:32
"I really like the game! But there's a problem that annoys me, whenever I play multiplayer, battle royale ,etc the hitbox is so rigged. The enemy is shooting a wall and I still managed to die? But whenever I hit a enemy they don't die??? I'll be willing to give it a 5 star if you fix this.",2,2023-07-14 14:43:01
"I seriously don't understand why this game decides to put me in a game with all bots on my team, meanwhile the whole enemy team is real people. They seriously need to fix this problem, I'm tired of it, and want warzone mobile to release now! This is a very bad game, I'm tired of having all bots on my team and the enemy team is just a bunch of damn sweaty people. Very bad game!",1,2023-07-14 12:13:43
Call of Duty Mobile is All good and fine but since Yesterdays (13/07/2023)update I am unable to start the game(Timeout Bug) even though My Internet connection is fine(works perfectly for any other games) and checked it multiple times weather it is working nicely or not. I tried reaching support system but their website is full of this and that links and there is no direct way of contacting a support team like chat system or sending an email (which is another hectic issue). Finally Uninstalled it,1,2023-07-14 10:25:56
"Game is completely unplayable. Lags to the point of crashing every match. Then the game bans you for leaving the match forcing you to wait before you can play again, and gives you a ""Ranked Match Penalty"" on top of that. Glad I didn't spend money on this garbage. Takes up massive amount of storage space and forces you to download more content in game before allowing you to play.",1,2023-07-14 08:18:50
"Most of the time I play against literal bots. It's a hit or miss with my team, and the other team are either shooting at the sky, or tracking you through walls. Sometimes I'll get a jump from going against 3 year olds to fighting against someone that plays like they are MLG. Game also currently takes up 24GB if you don't want it to look look dull.",2,2023-07-14 05:51:07
"At the start it's all bots which is rubbish, once your into the higher ranks it's simply a case of who gets VTOL or helicopter airborne first, there's little combat and actually gets quite boring. There should be an option to play without assists, foot soldiers only. I'm only level 110 and it's becoming a bit of a drag. Devs need to shake up the game to keep it fresh and not just add weird weapons and marvel style characters. Maybe made an adults version, just regular soldiers and REAL weapons.",2,2023-07-14 03:16:08
"Great game!! But need to fix the respawning issue in death matches or when we join a running match. Spawn the player in their team's side rather than the enemy side. Also, if we can reduce the loadout drop time, that would be great.",5,2023-07-14 01:55:43
"Fun game, I love it. It's just expensive to buy the in game CP points. I know the developers have to make money too, and I don't expect everything free, I just feel a small price reduction could get more people to enjoy the DLC or battle pass content much better and easier. Lower prices means more customers. Happy customer, repeat customer. Everybody wins.",5,2023-07-13 20:06:34
"I absolutely love the game and I've been playing it for years now! The only problem I'm facing from the last 6 months or so, is that my game lags a lot. My friend and all the other players can start the game and play alright, but I get stuck in the pre-game lobby itself. I enter mostly when half game is done and sometimes now I have to sit out throughout It feels sad, running around like mad in the pre-game lobby and I can't even see guns. This is the only reason for giving 4 stars. Please help!",4,2023-07-13 17:05:22
"Stop making us download everything that we downloaded before the updates. Like, why do I need to download the old stuffs again after the updates. I should be only focusing on the new downloads only, why the old ones that I downloaded ages ago. That is a huge problem that you guys have. On the other hand you did great job with the game. Absolutely loving it. Just fix that issue only. I have been playing for almost 3 years. It's been a great journey. Thanks.",4,2023-07-13 16:39:28
"Very good game but not what it used to be couple yrs ago and when your freinds are online in a battle what is the point of having a spectate button ? If u can't not spectate them ? U should be able to spectate friends as well as spectate them during a private room as well , what's the point of that button if it doesn't do anything ? 🤔",4,2023-07-13 14:58:18
"So many bugy lately, events not loading at all no matter what i do, the timeout issue is even worse now, unplayable unless this is fixed, many people have the same issues but the developers just don't care, otherwise its a good game but it needs fixing",3,2023-07-13 14:17:12
It's a first person shooter what do you expect it's gonna have bugs and it's going to have it's bad moments but at the same time it's a good game and I really love it. It's cool it's part of my daily routine and whene I play it is a beautiful and stunning game with really good graphics. It's what you would always want out of a first person shooter it's great. 5 star rating.absoulutley stunning game. You just got to love it.,5,2023-07-13 13:03:01
"After each season, it downloads more data while not deleting/overriding on the previous season's data. The game size just keeps on increasing eventually due to this which is not how it's supposed to work.. Currently the game is taking 28 GB on my deviceplease fix this!",3,2023-07-13 09:00:34
"This game is degrading day by day. There is no actual attempt to fix problem mentioned by player; just increasing size (storage). No smooth playing experience. Make player leave in ranked matches and facing penalties several times in a day. CODM just don't value its players. It's hurtful to rating this awesome game so low. But why should we invest so much in this unoptimized, oversized, downgrading game? They are forcing to leave the game. Really time to consider other options",2,2023-07-13 08:15:55
This game has so many bugs and glitches from last two years I am playing this game but recently the game start misbehaving with phone when I start the game it shows network issue and it automatically excited the game in between matches and i lost lotes of rank xp because of this and also it show slow network with 100mb/s wifi brotband connect and i face lages like not able to see apponent and got killed in games and in one vs one face havey lage issues so please fix it and improve it,3,2023-07-13 08:14:52
"This game is great when your finally inside playing but the waiting process is too long. Another issue is that it uses too much data besides when it needs to be updated. Every day or two I have to download something which is not even optional and everytime I want to loge in I have to wait around 5 min, it's driving me crazy honestly",3,2023-07-13 08:14:47
"Love the game, however as many people have pointed out the game has a bug that kicks you out matches because of your internet but the internet is fine. Its somethinf to do with the game. Also it would be nice to be able to filter out maps. Its annoying having to redownload EVERYTHING after each update especially as they update it alot",3,2023-07-13 07:21:07
"I'd give this zero Stars if I could. Nowhere does Activision tell you that if you're using a guest account and even if you spend money if you uninstall and reinstall or change devices you lose all of your progress. And there is no way to recover it. Activision doesn't have a phone number you can use and the email is useless too. If you download this game bear in mind don't use a guest account because even if you spend money, it will all be gone and you'll be screwed out of your money and time!",1,2023-07-13 04:36:19
"Oi what happened to the 2,400CP Bundles?! Bring those back! Latest 2 updates have not been able to update without uninstalling and installing which costs alot of time and internet, why is this?? Best game you can get. Need to make the weapon change and knife draw the same in MP as it is in BR cos that auto appearing knife button is sooooooo frustrating! And go back to opening tiers manually cos after every game thats so annoying as well.... bet everyone agrees on those 2 points.",4,2023-07-13 02:18:57
If you play other games like this there usually bad .So this one is a big yes though it does take up a lot of space on older phones.And their costumers service is bad and it's really fun and you can tell a lot of good and hard work went into this.But not anymore alot of times there's massive bugs and nothing new or fun to play on it it just becomes reppetive.And right now the game developers are just looking for a cheap way to get cash and it's hard getting good teamates nd guns are way o strong,4,2023-07-12 23:00:02
Call of Duty Mobile is not just a game it has become religion. Thank you Activision for this amazing game. I had joined CODM in Season 7 Elite of the Elite 2021. It's been almost 2 years i have been playing this game and it's getting better and better. I request developer to please add Season 7 2021 music track to game and Season 1 2021 reward character Kruger Ruptured Steel to Construct Reward. No words to explain graphics and gameplay. Just love it.,5,2023-07-12 22:33:44
"The game is fun and cool graphics makes it even more attractive and addictive. But I think codm should add self reviving kit. And also, please someone tell me what's the use of fighter plane in the game? When someone takes that he kind of becomes invincible. I think they should remove that useless stuff.",4,2023-07-12 17:23:36
Amazing game just one problem that made this 3 Stars that fact that you can join a game late. There are times I will join a game and it's about to be finished or there is no way in god's name the team I joined can win. if someone leaves replace it with a bot. so frustrating.,3,2023-07-12 13:56:00

"Absolutely amazing! Runs very smooth, looks great and has the old cod feel. Lots of familiar maps from older games. I am using my xbox series x controller and just feels incredible. Been a while since I played cod and I'm stoked to be playing it again on a phone!",5,2023-07-12 12:38:11

"The DEVs don't care. After two years of this game I'm done. The BR is trash. In farm windmill, put 20 rounds in a guy coming up stairs to get 1 shot by a shotgun, fully Kinect armor. The game is trash. If your gunna make shotguns one shot people make snipers do the same. It's utter garbage. Get good with a shotgun or you'll lose every BR match.",1,2023-07-12 04:11:38
"Graphics look good for a mobile game. Love the fact they have a credits system that is separate from the other currency system which you have to pay for so you can either work for your rewards or buy different ones. Like how the epic and above rarities are blueprints and the ones below are camos so you can tell a difference between them. Gameplay is alright as well, multilayer can be either chill or really sweaty, however zombies needs more maps as having just one kills the game mode. BR is easy",4,2023-07-12 01:37:53
This is a suggestion: ad the ability to lay down on your back for more style and add a mission mode where 4 players take on missions in different locations it could eather be stealthy or loud they can choose. They go up against the shadow company from call of duty 2.0 and the ability to buy new outfits and finishers that's all I have for the next update,5,2023-07-12 01:35:46
The game is good but today I went to play but instead of me playing it made me create a new ac even though I alr had one but then I saw all my progress be deleted and idk if its just me or anyone else had it if it's a bug I hope it gets fix cuz my progress from level 1 to 120 got deleted and my skins and wepons and now I'm starting from the beginning...,1,2023-07-11 23:54:17
"Very impressed with the latest updates 😮‍💨 I am not complaining but just asking very nicely if y'all could consider finally making the controllers work with the menus 😆 It's not hard to do. I don't understand why it's been avoided 😂 But overall this game has come a long way and I recommend this to any one looking for a FPS on the go! Very beautiful and great work with the store updates and basic UI touch ups, along with adjusting the mechanics to create a more fair environment Keep at it",5,2023-07-11 23:46:16
They added some sort of anti-cheat that makes it so you only do headshot damage so for being wrongly accused of soft aim this app deserves 1 star. I've seen a few other reviews saying the same thing or maybe its just a server issue. Not to mention that connecting a controller is the worst experience I've ever had! Also you lose ranked MMR if u leave during pre-match!,1,2023-07-11 23:26:07
"The game is meh, the guns and experience and sounds are good but it is heavily Pay to Win. There are all sorts of guns for you to buy that give you gross advantage over free to play players. While having an advantage for maybe a couple bucks is nice, these weapons cost hundreds maybe even thousands of dollars. Not to mention the game's size. Almost 20 Gigabites, so unless you have a beefy iPad this game might not run well. Final verdict: play this game if you really want but I recommend not.",2,2023-07-11 22:13:20
Runs pretty smoothly on my older device still. Only minor lag issues from time to time and few spawn in glitches where you are stuck out of map parameters and can't move it seems. Glad they brought back Zombies.,4,2023-07-11 21:12:04
"What a game, what an exprnce. What a master piece👌. Its got its lags and flaws; Of which I not sure if my network prvider 🤔 or the game itself. Also the fact that I never seem to and myself a epic/legendary, you the nice weapons with animated kills is those draws. I gave up, man I'm tired of wasting cp points/cash on a parachute or a grenade/flashbang...😒 Other than that.. The last three years of CODM has been lekker. It's been hundreds. Thnx a lot... You know the price of a console today",5,2023-07-11 20:03:54
"Used to be a great game but, now it's awful. Take BR for instant you have too many sweats picking up mythical weapons off the ground which are more powerful then the base version of the gun so, its pay to win basically. Till they remove the mythical & epic guns from ground loot it'll always be advantage to those that pay.",1,2023-07-11 18:14:16
Literally 2 year ago u give it 5 star but now I changed my device and I am not able to login I event spent money on this game I can't even link it with another platform it always show error and when I link to call of duty account it shows the my email and password is wrong but when I try to create an account it show email is already in use,1,2023-07-11 17:31:44
"Simply THE BEST mobile game, period. With so many game modes, options, yet incredibly intuitive to use, meaning low frustration, you don't need to look for another game once you got this.

"Absolutely horrible servers and connection. Despite having a more than sufficient internet connection and a decent connection speed, it still always gives me 200ping as soon as there is even the slightest drop in network.

"Very bad experience. Weapons are too toxic, we don't have any choice for new maps in ranked match and bots are the most annoying thing now in codm. Campers everywhere. If the game is not improved soon then I'll switch to Warzone Mobile. Its no more a skilled game, so toxic and the bots always annoy me.",1,2023-07-11 14:16:07
This new update is too f slow and lagging. While download the content it show high speed but while playing the game it show 0.2 kb/sec speed. Not for Mid range Mobile. You have to buy above Rs 30000 price mobile if you don't want too much slow and lag,1,2023-07-11 13:58:06
"Pay to win game. People who own paid gun skins have better aim and accuracy in ads . A good game, but too bad that they don't have tpp in multiplayer but doesn't really concerns me. The reason for my rating is because of the custom iron sights on paid weapons, it's hard to aim when you have a bad iron sight, but easy when you have a paid gun skin with better iron sight to get better aim and accuracy",1,2023-07-11 13:27:53
"I have been playing this game for 2 years ,it's an awesome experience. But nowadays In mp mode it takes too much time to play a single match . Now suddenly an other error occurred.

"Amazing game But the amount of crashes,glitches and timeouts, it isn't worth it Even with an high end device and speedy wifi which can support larger games like genshin, I'm still facing a large amount of problems First it was 'getting version info', then extremely irritating crashes and lags If you ask me , don't waste your time here , other games like Pubg or Freefire are better They better not fugg up warzone mobile",2,2023-07-11 09:29:39
"My experience is Awesome !! - When I'm connected It doesn't show some events, That can be fixed by restarting. - Login error On Homepage FB or Activision, Can be fixed By Updating Google & Chrome app - Runs Very Well smoothly even at low Frame rates , my supports High But Battery issues so Low is Best.",5,2023-07-11 09:13:25
This game used to be working fine with some lags and glitches. But it keeps asking me to login even when I have already logged in and it does this sometimes in the middle of a battle but ever since I started downloading more of the other maps and stuff the game sends me straight back to the home screen and asks me to continue to codm I have to log in again. Fix this now. This game is very fun so pls fix these bugs. I am also logged in through Google play.,4,2023-07-11 08:06:23
"The game is nice, in all such games available like BGMI, Free Fire, the MP mode of this game is best, however, for BR, I would go with BGMI. The reason for me giving it 4 stars is that Activision is being a gold digger, and is releasing P2W skins, all new mythic guns has a in-built Red Dot, which enables them to add 5 attachments without the optic, it cares less about the ones who can't afford those skins. Also, the timeout issue is back in season 6 2023",4,2023-07-11 07:27:53

I'll be playing fine on Literally any other game and when I go on COD it works for a while then just says connection is unstable. Why? I just wanna play with my friends.

It's too heavy into the pay to win... and the game is lagging....they deleted alot of weapons and Equipments from the battle royal ......in 2019 battle royal graphics was great but now it's greet too but not like 2019 graphics...the backpack level 3 was carry 10 things and now it's 8 ...we want them to bring the old healing system...and the old graphics...and the old MP and BR lobby,1,2023-07-11 02:00:57
"Total Junk game. And Activision will never respond to the players because they don't care. Try to find a dev response. You can't. Total Trash Game but there's not much else on mobile until Destiny is released. Thank God everything is so expensive so I'm not tempted. That's a plus at least. And all the low reviews? How is this game 4.3/5 stars. Such a scam rating. Garbage company, garbage game, oh well.",1,2023-07-10 20:02:47

"I'm giving five stars because I do enjoy the game but I have one complaint. I just won top rank in the recent tournament and the reward for cod points is deceiving. It shows 3k cod points along with a frame and the special effects medal, but you only receive the frame and medal. The points have to be purchased to unlock premium rewards. The cod points were the only thing worth the hard work and you don't get them. Just a frame and medal that only last 7 days. Not worth the time I spent AT ALL.",5,2023-07-10 18:32:06

"I have been playing this game since 2019 and am a huge fan of COD. But since last 3 seasons there is a glitch due to which the game is not loading and opening properly. It is not a network issue as other apps are working fine. Also most of the time when you open the game some icons (like event, draw etc) are missing. This is very disturbing and disappointing. I love this game, but time out issues like these are losing my interest in playing it. Please fix this loading an time out problem asap.",5,2023-07-10 14:38:40
"Best game there is. I can't have enough of it. The controls, the gun loadout system, everything is so neat. Edit: Updates are very annoying tho. First you update from playstore. Then you download those resources in game then you still have to download camos, skins and maps. And this happens every update. Why can't you make it so that when you update, everything stays while just adding the new stuff. It's as if you first delete the pre-existing data and have to re-download everything from scratch",4,2023-07-10 11:21:43
"Notice how they hide all the bad reviews or delete them, also if you wanna win make sure you pay a bunch of money so you can get the hidden bonuses they give out.

Or if the game has extra code. I watched a player running like the flash with a katanna. He out ran bullets. I feel my time is wasted reporting every single game. I see the same gamer tag repeatedly.

It takes up wayyyy too mucn storage ! I've had Call Of Duty since it was first released in 2019 and have since had to delete it from my phone several times over the years due to the app taking up wayyy too much space ! You have to find out some way to make it at least 10 GB max ?? It currently takes up 22 GB and with EVERY update I have to delete more apps and pictures but obviously it can't keep taking up so much space because at some point no one will want to use or play Call of Duty anymore,1,2023-07-09 21:46:52
"The game is great, not the reason for the one star. Reason for the one star is they just simply DO NOT care about the players. You can play for free yes, however the cost of the items if you chose to get them is insanely high. 150 dollars tonget Templar and maybe another 250 to max him maybe 400 because the roll odds for mystic cards is insulting. If you have people who are willing to spend the money, reward them with half, decent rose at the very least.",1,2023-07-09 20:48:23
What could be an amazingly fun game on the phone that you can pick up and play to have fun with is ruined like most things in the world by greed. Yes you can play this game and have fun with it if you never want anything of note but this game continually flaunts skins in your face that they expect you to pay for. I personally out more money into this trash than I expected as an experiment and still wasn't able to get what I wanted because I can't pay a decent price and get what I want. STAY AWAY,2,2023-07-09 20:21:26

I just don't understand why I should download all my skins and cosmetic items and background files after every update, it wastes time since those downloads have been limited to about a max of 500kb/s in South Africa.

I've been playing this game for years and recommended it to everyone I've come across. But recently the timeout bug has been so annoying. The network works fine and yet there's this bug. The device has a SD 888 and 8 GB of RAM. Then why are so many people suffering from this bug? I lose the will to open and play the game when I try to restart it 7-8 times.

"FPS issue. I get that Activision needs to make money, but it's frustrating that my RedMagic 7 phone with 18GB RAM and support for up to 165Hz can only manage 90fps. This limitation exists because my phone isn't sponsored like Apple or Asus, which feels unfair. I've bought over 40 legendary guns, 3 mythics, and the mythic specter, splurging on draws. Adding up the cost, it's enough for 4 ROG phones. However, due to my choice of the RedMagic phone for serious gaming, I'm now stuck with just 90fps",1,2023-07-06 08:13:52

Especially if u end up deleting it on accident get ready for at least a hour minimum for the basic items to play. So thats why I give it a three star.,3,2023-06-30 07:55:15
Very fun game grate for playing with friends but I think they should add back prop hunt. I think that would make the game way funner and people will play the game more and make more content out of it and that will make the game have more downloads. But overall 5/5,5,2023-06-30 07:38:33

I will play the game. It plays fine. Gameplay is great. But no one should ever have to pay 100 bucks to get a legendary gun with special affect.

Plenty of options for operators and special blueprints for 20 bucks and less sometimes.,1,2023-06-24 08:19:39
Addictive action game and there r only few action games at top levels and COD holds one of them.

It used to be a halfway decent game. Nowadays it's barely okay. I noticed the bot behaviors and the Bots tactic in the deception. It's all too often that the enemy Bots kills my bought teammate every single time. Talking about a bit of obviousness more like a bit of disrespectfulness.

It's good but attack of the super undead is not fair if ur opponent has the shadow blade bring back normal attack of the undead. Take diesel out of ranked if you try to get kills you have to go through the maze of houses and if you try to go on the road you get sniped instantly. If you play big head blizzard it gets so laggy and sometimes it's where your moving your movement button but your character isn't moving until it loads and your dead.

Controller suddenly doesn't work as of this week / today (6/20/23). It displays the dialog box of what is the controller you're using (I select XBOX) and then nothing. 2 stars for it being fun before. 2 stars for it suddenly not letting me have fun because I've been playing with controller and I need to git gud with touch screen,2,2023-06-20 23:56:02

Other than that it's great 👍",3,2023-06-20 06:35:17
New idea concept! I think you guys should incorporate street fighter in this game and revive it with mini games as a option. Just a idea before it becomes retro. It is definitely my idea. Yet no one will acknowledge this concept.,5,2023-06-20 04:26:36

Matchmaking of Multiplayer ranked match is stupid I always matched with players who cant play properly or have ping issues and the multiplayer ranked match penalty system is crazy your lots of points get minus and can't play for the next 4 or 5 minutes. And points deduction system for defeat is also crazy I play with a strategy make most kills and if we lose the match points get deducted no matter what rank. Points distribution isn't fair points need to be given according to our performance,2,2023-06-19 15:29:59
It's the best game ever according to me. You will not get this kind of graphics in any other mobile game and it has more than 30 to 40 modes in mp and br. You can also play it with friends (including private matches) in which ever mode you want. It requires a little bit more space and wifi than other games.,5,2023-06-19 13:52:20

The main problems are as such: The snipers are too overpowering and it feels like I can't move without dying, there's only one (maybe two) zombies maps, and the game takes up far too much space. Could you please: alter bullet velocity, bring back iconic zombies maps, and try and compress some files please? Thank you.",5,2023-06-17 13:15:36
Hello I am very happy playing this game it is challenging with great environment and community and I thank the developers for such a good game. But there is something bad about it. It lacks in music there are some ridiculous tracks in the safe house. It is better if the developers add some tracks of codmw2 2009 hans zimmer They are epic. It will be awesome to have those great peaces in the game. I love mw2 (old version) because of it music. Codm is much better if I listen to epic music in lobby,5,2023-06-17 12:27:46

Honestly, I've put up with the game and it's getting really frustrating and yes it's a new phone, it's up to date and so is the game and there's a lot of storage.

It's a okay game however it just gets bombarded with adds to buy new weapons and skins as soon as you open the game aswell as when you play games such as 10 v 10 the games are full of ai let alone they have the 'greatest aim' even when they're not looking at you they somehow hit you within 2 shots.

This game is such a ripoff. I decided to do the liquid light draw. What a mistake that was. I had to spend almost 150.00 to unlock the weapon that I wanted. Smh. The only reason I ended up spending that much is because I did not realize how much the price would go up for each roll. it was easier to continue than just lose my money which I still feel happened anyway. But at least I got the weapon I was going for. I will never spend another dollar on this game again.,1,2023-06-13 07:44:25

"I'm writing this review to appeal to CODM. The game play is very good, it's the best. But creating an Activision account helps to recover your account right when device changes or in case of app loss right? Well I did and now I can't seem to login. Please help me gain access to my favourite game",5,2023-06-09 08:03:07
I don't have the most up-to-date phone however it's performance isn't bad on other high graphics type games. The game used to run a lot better but now even on lowest graphics I'm losing so much fps that someone with a bat can kill me while I'm still shooting at them. Hit boxes are so weird. I watch a replay of a game I played and the player was not even shooting the body yet he still got the kill. Secondary equipment needs updating And same with score streaks. 3 stars because it's not too bad.,4,2023-06-09 03:31:38
செம்ம. Patta. Beautiful game. I already played all pc games of COD. Now it's on mobile thank you team. In our country biggest issue is no service providers can maintain there speed.Only main city people can play without lag. Developers can't improve it.So don't blame on developers. Lag is country situation. All can play with actual midrange phones. not in budget phones.,5,2023-06-08 23:26:32
"Kill Streaks are way Overpowered, needs an option for multi-player lobby with these disabled. Wait times for ranked matches are ridiculous once you reach elite, pro, master, etc. Needs options to disable killcam and skip all the tier upgrade stuff, just trying to play on my breaks, don't have time to wait. Constantly having to carry whatever team I'm stuck on so need access to better player lobbies or better team placement.",3,2023-06-08 17:51:23
"My experience is great, however....I have bad times playing the game properly because in Battle royal my teammates always shoot down my vehicles then I die and that is unfair because most of the time, they don't revive me! And they destroy a helicopter with like 15 bullets it insane! Helicopters should take like 35 bullets atleast, and after the new update came out the ranks went lower that makes sense, but now I'm fighting people that was legendary rank and then I loose and loose. It's unfair!",3,2023-06-08 09:12:08
The game is great i love the gameplay and everything but i use a samsung ao4e and the graphics have been set to low so maybe like you do something for us who use low end devices and enable other graphic options just to enjoy the game at high quality. Am not really asking for much just graphics.,4,2023-06-08 05:54:16
Now I know why CoD franchise has such a cult status. To be fair I have never played PC or Console version of CoD. This is first time I've experienced CoD. And now I can imagine how exciting the PC or Console version of this game will be. The only reason why I am giving it one star less is that it sometimes have connectivity problems. Even though I have a good wifi in my house it sometimes shows problems with connection.,4,2023-06-08 05:27:47

I've been playing call of duty since season 3 I would give Activision 0 stars for this game if I could I bought a premium battle pass and I never got it when I claimed it it did not show up in my inventory. Activision has zero customer support except for a chat that is run by people who keep giving me a runaround about giving me what was paid for. They keep changing the person who is working on the situation and they keep telling me the same things to try over and over again that are not working,1,2023-06-07 01:32:33
"Cod mobile is fun. Played this when season 1 came out. The cons of the game is that the developers still DO NOT have the proper software to detect a hacker nor cheater while being played. The fact that a gamer can be really good to the point where it makes the cheater lag the game and 1-tap my entire squad within seconds of each other is outrageous. PLEASE DEVELOPERS, IF YOU FIND A WAY TO STOP THE CHEATERS AND HACKERS, I SUGGEST YOU MAKE A SERVER FOR ONLY CHEATERS N HACKERS, SO OTHERS CAN PLAY.",4,2023-06-07 00:48:28
"Everything's great to me. Decently balanced for the most part, not too many hackers or cheaters.

Incredible have been playing the game since it first released! Almost 3 years now and it still continuous to impress me before it released I used to play Fortnite and pubg so when it released I was absolutely blown away by the graphics comparing to Fortnite. But they kept improving them and made it even better then pubg ones and now it's absolutely amazing the graphics are top level the frame rate is amazing and the amount of action toxicality sweats & tryhards is insane...

"It's one of the best games I've played, really enjoy all the modes, and the scenery of the maps really take me back to the old games, controls are really easy and modes are fun, can be pretty competitive sometimes but only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because zombies kinda suck I mean theirs only one map, n as you progress there's wayy too many mini bosses I would like to see new maps and less mini bosses in one of the new updates.",4,2023-06-05 23:38:30

"This game is so much fun! Though I wish that you would get new guns weekly. I also wish that we could have a main campaign in this game like vanguard, MW, MW2, and advanced warfare all had campaigns, but also I would like the ability to craft custom guns from other gun parts. I feel like that would be fun to experiment with for battle royals and multiplayer. Thanks for the good times and keep doing good work.",5,2023-06-05 19:24:57
"Wonderful! Just adding these make the game better- 1)The wall assist must be stopped,as it gives unfair advantage and makes hiding hard 2)There must be ranked mode especially for gunfight,which makes the game interesting for guys who play with a single friend 3)A new 20 min battle royale map could be released 4)A moving train in battle royale map which s final destination is safe zone will make it more interesting, as battle inside a moving train will be great and could let players relax a while",5,2023-06-05 13:56:25

"Hello, I would like the developer team to focus on some issues happening now in the newer updates. The weapon upgrades has made it more complicated: weapon attachments, levels of weapon, and snipers are bit out of control. And regarding Battle Royale , changes in Map could be more helpful.

I am a player from OG season 1. I used to love the game. But the game changed slowly after season 8. After season 8 the game became buggy and laggy. And even after 4 seasons after that it's still the same buggy and glitchy. Somewhat more. Although they gave many free skins and camos. Still it's getting annoying now for those bugs and glitches. That's the only reason I changed my rating from 5 to 2 stars. So my req to devs that please fix these issues first and make our loved codm like before.,2,2023-06-04 06:51:32
I love this game and wish I could give you a 5 but I have been shooting enemies and I know they would surely hit like a sniper you cant miss if you aim right nut I was using a AK-47 and i knew my bullets would hit and never did and I die by that same enemy who wasnt shooting me. I very rarely encountered some people who are under the map and won the matches that way. And also when I did the placement match I lost my rank that same day I went from Pro II to Veteran V. I did it after season start.,4,2023-06-04 04:36:00

It is also normal in this kind of games, but it does this in most of the cases like 8/10. So if you wanna grown, you CAN NOT DO IT FREE!!!

Also, my razer kishi controller doesn't work, which is very stupid.",4,2023-06-03 22:46:58
Multiplayer mode is very good. Graphics are good in that part however if we talk about battle royale then graphics are not good. Guns options are limited too in battle royale. Even if you are the best sniper then also. It is impossible to kill someone from Distance in battle royale because of Its interferce. Really looking forward to see better interface and grapics also new guns in battle royale.,4,2023-06-03 19:54:27

I've been playing COD for a while now and I must say it's a captivating game Not until you start getting killed too easily than you can kill others then it becomes very close to trash and annoying. Players on mobile shouldn't be playing with players on computer. I should not get killed with a gun easily than I can kill someone with that same gun Once I get a call in the game my network seems to reset and it doesn't come on after the call not until I put it in airplane mode.

First of all, if a ranked match gets disconnected because of network problems, the blame and penalty is put on the player for leaving the ranked match. He/she is banned from ranked matches for 5 mins and xp is deducted. Secondly, the team making system of this game, no matter in what mode, is extremely poor. You get extremely bad teammates along with a way stronger opposing team whenever you are close to a ranked milestone.",3,2023-06-03 08:59:25

One thing def to improve on, would be more maps, and easier ways to aquire mythic/Legend weapon because it's a big adv compared to not having one.

This needs to be fix, I have read reviews and I am not the only one is a good game but if it doesn't get fix this game will be loosing gamers. There's no way to play like that. Hope they fix this soon...",1,2023-06-01 05:56:42
Please add new characters in ranked mode of multiplayer category and you have to add search and rescue in ranked it is just great. Some new maps challenges need to be incorporated in ranked multiplayer portion.,5,2023-06-01 05:36:44
Edit: Game is fun until you get higher ranked. Once you are higher ranked it seems like you get nerfed bad. I have been killed with one shot from the same gun that I shot someone twice in the face point blank and it didn't kill the other player. Kind of makes it a lot less fun when they do that. Seems to reset with each season though.,3,2023-06-01 01:01:52
I gave this game 5 stars once upon a time but I have to change it. Game is overall a great game but when you send in multiple messages about the w.c games not registering and never get a response back after a few weeks is a bit annoying. Then when you don't follow a subscription and get suspended (which I new would happen) and get told you have 1 day left and that day comes and boom you have a 120 day suspension for abusive behavior when you barely talk or interact with anyone is dumb,3,2023-06-01 00:15:13
"It's a fun game but the huge updates every week is annoying, you can almost never play the game because every time you have free time, there's an update that takes 15-20 minutes to install and doesn't even change the game.",3,2023-05-31 20:17:03
"It's a good game, but the network errors lets me down, playing ranked matches is hard because I get penalties for leaving in the middle of the game even though I didn't necessarily left but a network error has occurred, this takes long time for me to get back at playing again. Also the ranked matchmaking takes forever, sometimes you don't get to play even after waiting for that long...please guys do something about it. The game also takes too much storage, I'm running it on a low end device 16Gb",2,2023-05-31 19:40:02
It's a good game. I played this in tandem with Apex Mobile when it was still out and I played both pretty evenly. I think my only real complaint about this game compared to other games like it is that it is an INCREDIBLE power hog. I could play all day with Apex Mobile and still have battery left at the end of the day. This game drains battery incredibly fast.,4,2023-05-31 16:47:43
This game keeps getting worse !! matchmaking in ranked sucks!! Every weapon is basically one shot no time to get behind the wall or nothing There is way too many campers (no fun) ! There is also constant downloads and connection problem !! Fix ur game Activision. I play since it's release and it was way better back in the day brink back og Codm.,1,2023-05-31 16:30:24
The game is very good and I love it but there's one problem whenever I do fast moves in close or long range fights the movement that I do isn't registered when I see it in the kill cam and in a long range map when I use a sniper and see the other enemy I sometimes miss and then after missing the shot I either run slide or prone before he shoots and I still killed and another problem is that when I shoot my bullet(only for marksman guns and snipers)andnotmissIstillgetkilledcuzmybulletdissapears,4,2023-05-31 14:36:07
"Yeah i love the game and everything,it's graphics,sound and all the other stuff is good but like,is this new update crashing on y'all phones or just mine? Because before I updated it to this latest version,I never encountered a game crash but now when I'm in the middle of a match it just closes itself and that makes me feel frustrated so kindly developers could you work on that",4,2023-05-31 14:24:01
I am playing this game since it's release it was a great game but in recent times since last season the time out bug or something else it's not loading properly it's taking minimum of 3 to 4 attempts to launch the game . So please Call of Duty team I request you to look into it,1,2023-05-31 13:58:01
"Why do you always start a new season half way through a calendar month so it's not possible to collect all daily login for each game calendar month ,the season are not aligned with physical months. I play every day to check off daily login for rewards, but the new caricatures are always put on just passed the cut off daily date thus unattainable why is that so please fix Excellent fun good time for a distraction addictive experience ,,outstanding graphics/sound best through headphones .",3,2023-05-31 13:07:43
"Good game but servers sometimes drop you and that can result in a ban. Wouldn't pay money for that. As of latest it's really getting worse. Games are ridiculously impossible or unbelievably easy. Sometimes you spawn right into a napalm drop, once okay the four times and then it's a fast spawn to boot. There seems to be some manipulation of health of the characters. It was good once because the graphics. Now you need a super phone. The Battle Royale mode is near unplayable frame rate issues.",1,2023-05-31 11:40:52

"Im editing my review. I installed it after a long time to enjoy it again. I downloaded there all additional data more than 10 gb. But it's lagging alot. I can't even play a single game. I set my graphics on lowest, but results are same. I'm very disappointed. I uninstalled it",1,2023-05-31 09:01:27
"Awesome game, very fast paced, and can be played totally free. Lots of fun. If you just want to have fun, play as it is, if you want to be competitive, you should invest in a mobile phone controller. Just adding a simple trigger and using thumb gloves make it more fun.",5,2023-05-31 07:36:57
"Great game, been playing for almost 3 years. My only minor gripe is on all that time I have only ever got a single legendary pistol from all the draws I've tried, and honestly, making it so you need to spend over €100 to get one on a draw is a bit off. Perhaps a reward for long term players would be nice🤔 Something for completing each year as a player maybe 😉",5,2023-05-31 05:09:14
"I love this game! I have gone to gold cross on many of the console versions. I think however that making mythic weapons only available to those who have the money to spare, creates a feeling of them cheating. I've been calling it the Mythic advantage. It does feel like that person is cheating. You could fix that by creating co-op side missions where the whole team that completely finished it gets the mythic weapons and character skins as a reward.",5,2023-05-31 01:34:55
Good game but really needs to sort out the glitches and network errors that occur. happening way to many times when you lock on to fire it glitches so enemy knows where you are and shoot you instead.,3,2023-05-30 22:50:24
"Used to be great, controller support for PS5 controller is completely broken.

"(update) Still a great game and if you are thinking of downloading ,give it a shot. As someone who has experienced the game for a couple of seasons, I'd say its fun but it has gotten repetitive especially if you prefer BR. I ask the cod developers to please consider putting a non classes mode. Also please fix the sliding movement in the game#fixcrouching#fixreloading",5,2023-05-30 10:36:49

I guess they need a change on voice system... If our teammate turn on their voices during game without using earphone or headphone we can hear all their surrounding people talking their things which is pretty annoying.. AND THE DOG TAGS are too big which is a problem while fighting... Thats all.. I HOPE THE DEVELOPER WILL FIX,4,2023-05-30 09:05:32
This game is nearly perfect but i have one issue.... Please for the love of god PLEASE bring back Hardcore mode. Their shouldn' be a reason why that game mode be included in the game. CallOfDuty was buit for it and its a shame that its not on your app... Other than that perfect game and before I forget please please PLEASE!!!! Change the prices for mystic weapons or make it so im able to buy them for a decent price and not gamble my entire paycheck away for a computer generated weapon.,5,2023-05-30 08:44:57

I've been playing the game for 4 years now and it's been an experience there has been so many good parts of the game it's just battle royale is just getting too sweaty people are using shotguns are just overpowered if you want to become a good player in the game have friends to help you out,5,2023-05-30 01:46:27
"No doubt, game is quite thrilling and fun to play. Many maps are there so no possibility of getting bored, but among these things the timeout err bug should be fixed as well. Restarting more than 10 times kills the will to play at all. Other than this it's cool👍",3,2023-05-29 16:32:31
"By far, it has been the best mobile game for 4 years. Although the community is toxic at times. I have playes this since the beginning and spent about 1,000. This is a mobile game worth playing. I get tired of it because its the best one out there, but once warzone releases and we have more to play in rotation i feel itll still be able to hold its own.

Tencent is known both for it's amazing games but atrocious micro-transactions. This game is a prime example of both. The game has it's merits. It's smooth even on low end devices with great graphics and gameplay. However there's a clear focus on skins and draws that is greatly influenced by Activisions decisions. There are many ideas that are put in play but none feel finished or complete which is a telltale sign that publishers are trying to milk the game without giving the developers time,5,2023-05-29 10:12:37
"I love this game right? It's awesome, you don't have to pay £60 to play it, But it's starting to become unplayable, it's not anything about the space or anything, my phone that I use is really good but I'm facing prominent lag issues when my setting were high, I've now reduced them but it's still annoying for when I'm in a ranked game, they also need to sort out the matchmaking cos I'm getting sick of enemy teams being godly, while my team's can barely co-ordinate where they are going. 4 stars..",5,2023-05-29 10:04:22
No words bruh literally no words listen I have 3years history in it it's just amazing and you know what...If I want to clear the storage I can't delete codm cuz this is the game which makes me smile everyday and you need to add some old great future in it and you should provide one free legendary weapon only one but to get that... That should be a hardest mission ever and the last one is this is the greatest ERA and don't give end......... I HOPE,5,2023-05-29 06:48:40
"1st of all, it gave me the best gaming experience on Android. Excellent graphics & designs. And, it gave me a good & constant fps on this kind of heavy gaming. I would definitely give it 5 star but, giving it 4 because it uses lots of storage after you download the essential downloads and, character & maps. If it would use little less storage, it would be great to use. The second reason is, sometimes I fail to login. Even after trying for more than 10 times. Please check this guys.",4,2023-05-27 17:53:24
"Absolutely love this game, play it on both mobile and emulator (Gameloop), it's COD 😁 I've an issue though, and my reason for 3 stars, I took a long break from playing and am getting back into it, there is a lot of content and characters I've missed out on over the years, very disappointed there's no way to get them after they've come and gone, would be awesome if you could give us a way to win/purchase past content like legendary characters, kinda like what you did with the old battle passes..",3,2023-05-15 14:43:10
"GET RID OF THE BUGS!!! THERE ARE CONSTANTLY BUGS IN THE SYSTEM. There is always an issue starting the game. I haven't seen the ""events"" page in two weeks now. And the worst thing is the ability for people on a computer to be playing against people on a mobile. I still play the game, but with each update, there is a new bug combined with an old existing bug that never seems to go away. Get it together already!",2,2023-05-13 11:39:43
"This game is really fun to play trust me... But the bugs from the past two seasons are getting really very annoying now... I thought that maybe it's because I am having network issues, but no... I've come to realisation that even with good mobile network this game is still not loading... It's making me want to give up on this game now coz I thought that maybe in the new season these bugs will fix... But I think that's still not the case... Maybe I'll download it again after everything is fixed.",2,2023-05-11 17:38:13
"I really and truly like the game except when COD doesn't count the kills. There's has been numerous of times when I played in a match and it wasn't confirming or counting my kills and I do have recordings of it, therefore I believe that a malfunction in the system. Please notice developers that a diagnostic is needed. Thank you for your consideration of improving the game, keep up the good hard work.",3,2023-05-11 01:26:06
Absolutely loved this game and still do. I've been playing since the 1st cod on PC. But the mobile version is horrible. Not in terms of gameplay but activision does a horrible job at maintaining the app. So many bugs. The latest one is where there's a timeout issue and the events don't show up. At the time I'm writing this I counted and booted my game 14 times and it still didn't show. The gameplay is enjoyable but app maintenance is horrible. And have to redownload the same items every season.,1,2023-05-06 22:02:59
"This is absolutely incredible. The tutorial was great and the gameplay is amazing. I haven't found any hackers yet. But one problem. When I started the game and completed the tutorial, I won my first 15 matches 20 to 6 or something. You should make people with higher ranks be able to join some low rank games. I'm just asking for a challenge. Also the size is crazy.",5,2023-05-05 13:37:48
I love this game 5 out of 5 no doubt. The only problem is when it glitches which is so annoying. For example when I have a clear shot just to kill in rank match it glitches and then I die . Another example when I log it it would kick me out and it would take me to my homescreen. Also I want the storage to decrease to at least 3 gb or 4gb so then I don't have to delete the game since its very entertaining for me to play.,5,2023-05-04 20:28:33
"This is one of the best rpg games on mobile. Although a small request, please introduce more randomness in map selection. Maps which are more war-like arena, with ruins, or actual jungle, or anything which gives more war like scenery. This one would only be a request. Please introduce a hostage mode, where we need to rescue hostage/hostages within timeframe with different strategies.",5,2023-05-04 12:44:50
"I've been playing this game now for a little over 3 yrs (give or take) and it still is exciting to me and is hands down my number 1 favorite game. Love how they are always changing things up and bringing in new rewards. The only downfall to the game would definitely have to be how much phone storage it uses. Once you install it and get in the game then you have to go (well it's not mandatory, but certain things are for certain games & whatnot) and download all the maps, guns, characters, etc..",5,2023-05-02 08:45:44
"Here's my opinion:- Pros- Has one of the most vast number of guns and gunskins, operators etc. Quite detailed models, has great animations and the comics are fun to read. The gunfights are great and the maps are quite well-done too. Cons- It's become very tech-ey, I miss the old realism that CoDM used to have. The matches are almost always filled with 1-2 bots. The game gets a bit laggy, even on a good-level phone. A few optimization issues need fixing too. I'd give 3.5/5 if I could.",4,2023-05-01 13:50:02
"A game that used to be good, but now its situation is very sad. The game lags and crashes every time, and the entire app is over 25GB. Even midrange phones can't handle it. Developers are too busy designing rainbow-colored legendary weapons that cost more than your salary, so they don't have time to fix crash issues and other bugs. Sorry, but I think it's time to say goodbye to beautiful memories.",1,2023-04-30 14:40:32
"Its an amzing game. A gamemode I really want to see is sticks and stones where you play with the crossbow and ballistic knife, and can reset the score with the combat axe aswell, thats a great mp gamemode. It would be awesome to get zombies back, like my fav part of the game was actually zombies, so it would be great if you bring it back. Its cool that you already have windows in, but whats the chance of making the game more pc-like, by adding things into the buildings?? Like couched and stuff?",5,2023-04-23 08:23:05
The game is overall great. But this of every month having to update the version and being almost 2GB plus additional downloads on the app itself is ridiculous man. So I'll give 4 Stars And with the latest update the game is horrible can't load it keeps stopping at 99 then says timeout and when it does get into the game all the stuff doesn't load some things are missing.. and impossible to load the game and I'm using a 8GB RAM and my internet is fine. It's like the has a big bug this is very bad,4,2023-04-22 09:42:02
"The game has a variety of weapons, variety of gamemodes, variety of vehicles and power ups even. It's great, there's alot to mess around with in game that gives you a fun experience, though it is sometimes unplayable, game freezes at will for no reason even when nothing is happening and my fps is sitting comfortably at 60, sometimes you can't even enter the game and login. Sometimes you can't enter matches as it gets stuck on the loading screen, hope this gets fixed, otherwise it's a great game.",4,2023-04-14 08:30:45
"Great graphics,fps and gameplay. When I first started playing every time I played br it crashed but then the bug just went away. I highly recommend this game it has many guns and attachments and there is many different game modes. You may experience some bugs or crashes once in a while but overall it's a great game. The zombie mode and maps is very fin highly recommend it.",5,2023-04-11 22:38:24
"I love playing the game and the graphics. But after the latest update the stupid game won't load up at all and show timeout error multiple times. And even if It loads, I'm blocked from most of the things like the missions and tournaments and shop etc. It's extremely annoying and i just wasted ½ hour just to load the game and it still didn't boot up. Please fix this cause it's making me wanna quit. And since this game uses a lot of space (10+ GB) i would happily uninstall it.",3,2023-04-10 06:45:09
"This game would be PERFECT without the bugs. You sometimes can't see the enemy, random short pauses in the game, the game logs off randomly, things not appearing on minimap, and the sound glitches out. There's probably more depending on what device you use. So if you have a new, lagless, perfect device, you'll probably really like this game. (Also you'll get addicted to spending money here)",3,2023-04-02 19:22:05
"Sometimes when I run the game, it closes by itself and I don't know what the problem is, maybe it will run after three or four attempts to open it. Other than that I don't have any problems, the gameplay is good, I like the new Battelle royal training mode after the last update The behavior of robots is a bit complicated but its good to warm up before the battle (My device model is POCO X4 GT)",4,2023-03-31 09:12:48
"First off for BR it would be cool if towards the end of the match it turned to night to add some suspense, next I'm glad you went back to classic zombies, but if you end up bringing back the other mode you should gather supplies at the bunker on the BR map until a nuke wipes it. If you don't have enough food/water you can still lose! Because frankly the teleporter makes no sense and is super boring. I did like the day/night cycle and I hope it's used again and in more places!! Update:PLEEASE!!!!",5,2023-03-29 22:39:00
"I never really thought I'd like any of the COD games, gave one a shot a few years ago and didn't like it. Very glad to say COD Mobile is absolutely incredible. The graphics are like something you'd see on a console (even the lower graphics setting!) and the frame rate is very high and consistent on my Huawei P20 Pro. All of the controls/aiming is simple and fun. The only changes I'd like to see are options to turn the subtitles off, and more graphics settings.",5,2023-03-29 16:43:44
